# Official FreeDV radio integrations

This repository contains the official FreeDV radio integrations (originally included as part of freedv-gui,
but now spun off into a separate repositorhy to make more clear that these are licensed differently from 
freedv-gui). We currently support the following radios:

* [FlexRadio 6000/8000/Aurora series](./src/flex/README.md)
* [KA9Q/Web SDR support](./src/ka9q/README.md)

## Building

```

# or:
$ git clone https://github.com/tmiw/freedv-integrations
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build:
